Beyond basic navigation, k9s offers powerful customization features including custom skins, plugins, and deep resource inspection.

### Step 01 - Custom Skins
You can change the look and feel of k9s by adding YAML skin files to `~/.config/k9s/skins/`.

### Step 02 - Plugins
k9s allows you to define custom shortcuts for executing commands on resources. These are defined in `~/.config/k9s/plugin.yml`.
Example: Add a shortcut to jump into a shell on a pod.

k9s integrates with `hey` to provide simple benchmarking of your services directly from the UI.

### Step 04 - Resource Management
